The first notion of near-vector spaces was introduced by Beidleman in 1966. Subse-
quently, several researchers like Whaling, André, and Karzel introduced a similar notion
in different ways. André near-vector spaces have been studied in many papers (for exam-
ple. In this paper, we add to the theory of near-vector spaces originally defined by
Beidleman. for André near-vector spaces, we investigate the subspace structure
of Beidleman near-vector spaces and highlight differences and similarities between these
two types of near-vector spaces.

The subspace structure of Beidleman near-vector spaces is inves-
tigated. We characterize finite dimensional Beidleman near-vector
spaces and classify their R-subgroups. We provide an algorithm to
compute the smallest R-subgroup containing a given set of vectors.
Finally, we classify the subspaces of finite dimensional Beidleman
near-vector spaces.
